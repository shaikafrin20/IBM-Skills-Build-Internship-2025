# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection Using IBM Cloud ML Services

This project is a capstone implementation of a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using **Machine Learning algorithms**, deployed on **IBM Cloud Machine Learning Services**. The system analyzes network traffic data to detect and classify various types of cyber-attacks and separate them from normal activity.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Cybersecurity threats are on the rise, and early detection of malicious network activity is critical. This project aims to create a robust ML-based system to identify network intrusions such as:

- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Probe attacks
- Remote to Local (R2L)
- User to Root (U2R)

The goal is to provide an early-warning system for malicious activity in communication networks.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The system follows a typical machine learning pipeline:

- **Data Collection**: Network traffic data with labels for attack/normal activity.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: A **Decision Tree Classifier** with ensemble learning was used.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score were used.
- **Deployment**: Hosted using IBM Cloud's AutoAI ML services.

## 🛠️ System Development

- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier + Ensemble Learning
- **Training Platform**: IBM Cloud ML Services
- **Input Features**: Protocol types, service type, traffic duration, etc.
- **Output**: Binary classification (Intrusion = 1, Normal = 0)

## 🚀 Deployment

The model is deployed and can be accessed through the following API:

## 📈 Result

The model achieved an impressive accuracy of **99.5%** on test data, making it a highly effective intrusion detection tool.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integrate with real-time traffic data for dynamic predictions.
- Use advanced ensemble techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Expand model to detect zero-day attacks.
- Enable integration with existing SIEM tools.
