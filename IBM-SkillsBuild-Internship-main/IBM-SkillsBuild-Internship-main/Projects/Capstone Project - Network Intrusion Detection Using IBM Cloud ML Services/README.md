<h1>Network Intrusion Detection Using IBM Cloud ML Services</h1>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>
Create a robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine learning. The system should be capable of analyzing network traffic data to identify and classify various types of cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) and distinguish them from normal network activity. The goal is to build a model that can effectively secure communication networks by providing an early warning of malicious activities.
